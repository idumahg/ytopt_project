# ytopt_project
This repo consists of the results of both the qmcpack and openmc runs

The openmc results are in both in the RF (using random forest) and DUMMY (using dummy) folders.

The RF folder further contains the subfolders: "with_quantization" and "without_quantization".

"With_quantization" uses quantization in modeling the config space while "without_quantization" uses the plain vanilla modeling.
